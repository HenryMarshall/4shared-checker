# 4shared link checker

If you're looking to check for unbroken links use [this *real*
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-link-checker/hbmbafpbabjejfhopjnmjanilieamiic?hl=en-GB).

This was is just a quick experiment into making cross-site requests with a
chrome extension. It adds a validate button to a [Google Custom Search
Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/) which checks to see if results are still
valid and colors them accordingly.
